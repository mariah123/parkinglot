# Parkinglot
Parkinglot Management System (WebApp &amp; Unit Test) (Frontend layer test case is in separate repo: https://github.com/mariah123/parkinglot_test.git)

## Database Setup

You just have to create a databse and update the connectionstring in appsettings. 
There is no need for separate db scripts to create table schema and store procedure, the application will execute the scripts it itself.
